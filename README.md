# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Steps to Install and Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/rishabhjambhulkar/ConnectVerse/tree/main>

```

### 2. Set Up the API Server
Navigate to the `api` directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd api
npm install
```

After the installation is complete, you can run the server using:
```bash
npx nodemon index.js
```

### 3. Set Up the Client
Next, navigate to the `client` directory and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

To start the frontend development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Accessing the Application
- The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:4000` (or whichever port you have configured).
- The frontend application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your Vite configuration).






Hereâ€™s a structured document based on your description of the full-stack web application:

# Full-Stack Web Application Overview

## Introduction
This is a full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It incorporates authentication features that allow users to sign up, log in, and log out, providing access to protected routes exclusively for authenticated users.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **React Router**: A library for client-side routing to enable navigation within the application.

- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for server-side development.
  - **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.

## Authentication
Authentication is implemented using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**, featuring:
- **Access Token**: A short-lived token that grants access to protected routes.
- **Refresh Token**: A longer-lived token used to obtain a new access token when the original access token expires.

### Benefits
This setup enhances security and user experience by:
- Allowing users to stay authenticated without frequent logins.
- Ensuring that access to sensitive routes is secured.
